# Trend-Prediction-using-supervised-LSTM
Predict choppy trends in Unemployment rate from a lagged GDP series using long short term memory networks

It is difficult to model trends, especially due to their inconsistent and volatile behaviour. But this task becomes relatively easy using a supervised learning approach with a secondary series whose trend is comparable to the original series. This project is an extension to an existing academic report I made for the course of exploratory data analysis. The challenge then was to identify a series which closely followed the unemployemnt time series.
