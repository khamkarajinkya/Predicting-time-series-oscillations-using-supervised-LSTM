# Predicting-time-series-oscillations-using-supervised-LSTM
Predict choppy trends in Unemployment rate from a lagged GDP series using long short term memory networks

It is difficult to model trends and oscillations, due to their inconsistent and volatile behaviour. But this task becomes relatively easy using a supervised learning approach with a secondary series whose trend is comparable to the original series. This project is an extension to an existing academic report I made for the course of exploratory data analysis. The challenge then was to identify a series which closely followed the unemployemnt time series.
